For this project I have used:

- **Latest version** - Android Studio Dolphin

- **Modular** - The app is broken into modules of features and libraries which can be combined to build instant-apps, complete apps or lite version of apps.

- **MVVM architecture** - Using the lifecycle aware viewmodels, the view observes changes from viewmodel.

- **Kotlin** - This app is completely written in Kotlin.

- **Android Architecture Components** - Lifecycle awareness has been achieved using a combination of Statemaps, ViewModels, Room database, Navigation component, Hilt, View binding.

- **Screen compatibility** - This app is compatible up-to 10 inch screen size. 

- **Screen Orientation**  - Handled the portrait & landscape mode & persistence of onConfigurationChanges.
